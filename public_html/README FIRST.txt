# Graphic Era Bus Reservation System
Graphic Era Bus Reservation System

This project is aimed at developing web-based applications for a repository or central location where data is stored and managed for students of the University.  The Bus
Reservation System is a web-based application that can be accessed throughout the
University.Every student of the university can access the portal to   reserve a seat and is able to reserve only one seat.
The system is an online application that can be accessed throughout the university and anyone can access with login provided, which will give better service to the students.
There is no such existing system and it is for the student's who have their classes till 5 and did not get the seat. Because many students capture more than one seat.
The Proposed system is a computerized system which is maintained at Centralized databases i.e. in automated forms it’s a very fast process. And maintaining all the records in online systems database which makes it very easy to reserve the seat.
